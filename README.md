# Automated Environment Provisioning Using IaC

## Objective
The objective of this project is to utilize Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automated provisioning of development, testing, and production environments.

## Steps
1. **Write Terraform scripts**: Define infrastructure using Terraform scripts.
2. **Test scripts**: Test Terraform scripts in a controlled environment.
3. **Implement version control**: Utilize version control (e.g., Git) for managing IaC scripts.
4. **Automate deployment**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate infrastructure deployment.
5. **Document setup and usage**: Provide detailed documentation on setup and usage guidelines.

## Deliverables
1. **Terraform scripts**: A set of Terraform scripts for automated provisioning of cloud environments.
2. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on how to use and modify the scripts.
3. **Usage report**: A report demonstrating the time and resources saved through automation.

## Skills Used
- Terraform: For defining infrastructure.
- CI/CD pipelines: Automating deployment using a CI/CD pipeline.
- Version control: Managing IaC scripts using version control (e.g., Git).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/eddzaa/Provision`
2. Navigate to the `terraform` directory: `cd src`
3. Modify the `variables.tf` file to suit your environment.
4. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
5. Plan the changes: `terraform plan`
6. Apply the changes: `terraform apply`


## Usage
Follow the guidelines provided in the documentation to provision, modify, and manage environments using Terraform.
